# Tools

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{tool_descs}

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}
</tool_call>

# Instruction

1. In each turn, you should start with <think> tag. In this tag, you need to conduct a step-by-step reasoning process about the image and question and evaluate whether tool use would be helpful and give the reason. If received tool results, you also need to analyze them.
2. If you think some tools are useful, call them in <tool_call> tag. 
3. If you think no more tools are needed, you can answer in <answer> tag. You need to provide a concise summary of your reasoning process that leads to the final answer. Besides, you also need to put a simple and direct answer in \\boxed{{}} for verification.

The structure of your response should be like this:
<think> thinking process satisfying the Instruction 1 </think>
(<tool_call> tool calls satisfying the Instruction 2 </tool_call> | <answer> answer satisfying the Instruction 3 </answer> )
